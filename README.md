# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
## Kaggle Competition
### AUGUST 2020

While learning data science, One of the first dataset that everyone would encounter is a housing dataset.For this project, the Ames Housing Data Set was used. This data set includes information for houses sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.The dataset was found through a Kaggle competition hosted by General Assembly.There are 2930 observations and over 80 features included in the data set.Following are the steps that I took to build a XGBoost regression model to predict house prices.

 1. Import libraries and data
 2. Data analysis
 3. Data cleaning(worked with missing values)
 4. One hot encoding of categorical features( both train and test data)
 5. Data pre-processing
 6. Model selection and Hyper parameter tuning (XGBoost Regressor)
 7. Fitting the model
 8. Prediction using test data
 
And then I prepared a submission file containing the predicted prices of the housing data set (test). I was able to come in the 2163 position on the leaderboard on my first submission.
