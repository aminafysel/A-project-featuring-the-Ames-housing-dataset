# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
## Kaggle Competition
### AUGUST 2020

While learning data science, One of the first dataset that everyone would deal with is a housing dataset.For this project, the Ames Housing Data Set was used. This data set includes information for houses sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.The dataset was found through a Kaggle competition hosted by General Assembly.There are 2930 observations and over 80 features included in the data set.IT provides a train and test data in csv file along with the description of each variables describing almost every features in a house.

Following are the steps that I took to build a XGBoost regression model to predict house prices.

 1. Import libraries and data
 2. Data analysis
 3. Data cleaning(worked with missing values)
 4. One hot encoding of categorical features( both train and test data)
 5. Data pre-processing
 6. Model selection and Hyper parameter tuning (XGBoost Regressor)
 7. Fitting the model
 8. Prediction using test data
 
I prepared a submission file containing the predicted prices of the test data set provided and made in to the 2163th position(top 42%) on the leaderboard on my first submission.
